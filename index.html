			<div class="section about">
				<div class="desc">Desmond and Ju met on a match-making website, where they started off by exchanging emails. They enjoyed talking via email and phone, so they went on a first date on February 7, 2014 at a sushi bar. It was a rainy evening, but their first date went really well. They went on more and more dates, and enjoyed activities such as playing ultimate frisbee, going on hikes, zip lining, trying out different restaurants, and taking trips together. At first sight, they probably seem like an interesting pair. One is over 6 feet tall and the other is barely 5 feet. One works in healthcare and the other works on software. They have many differences but they also share many similarities. They have similar sense of humor and common sense. They prefer spending time with a small group of friends rather than a large crowd. On first impressions, they're both shy. They've found in each other someone they love and respect, someone they want take the next steps with, and someone they want to share their lives with.
